# HematoVision-Advanced-Blood-Cell-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning

HematoVision aims to develop an accurate and efficient model for classifying blood cells by employing transfer learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset of 12,000 annotated blood cell images, categorized into distinct classes such as eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils, the project leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to expedite training and improve classification accuracy. Transfer learning allows the model to benefit from pre-existing knowledge of image features, significantly enhancing its performance and reducing computational costs. This approach provides a reliable and scalable tool for pathologists and healthcare professionals, ensuring precise and efficient blood cell classification.
